Create a client-side only rendered Nuxt 3 application that allows people to sign up for a product. If you don't have any experience with Nuxt 3, it's OK to only use Vue 3. The form should contain fields for email and password, which should be required and show an error if no value is entered. The password field should have a way to make the password visible. The user should be able to choose to receive occasional product updates and announcements. Once signed up, they should be presented with a success page.

Please use the Provet Cloud Design System ([https://provetcloud.design/]) appropriately.
Read https://provetcloud.design/web-components/#installation-1 to learn how to use the Provet components in Vue. If possible, use TypeScript; however, JavaScript is also fine.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
